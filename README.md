CIS 193 Final Project
Pasadena City College

Final group project I completed on my own. 

This project was based on some the taught Javascript in class. It wasn't necessary to code HTML or CSS from scratch but I preferred to do it that way.

I added javascript functionality to various pages.
Most of the javascript was taken from the text book used in class as per the professor's requirements

I also found javascript files and help online via stack overflow, google, w3schools, code pen etc. 

**Two of the pages used I couldn't get the functionality to work. I am not sure what happened but I will go in and start over so they will match the other pages.

All in all I am happy with the site and how it came along
